# Binary Search Activity: Real-World Application

## Introduction

Binary search is one of the most efficient searching algorithms used in real-world applications. Instead of checking every item one by one (like linear search), binary search works by repeatedly dividing the search space in half. This makes it incredibly fast for large datasets.

Think about searching for a book in a library catalog, finding a product in an online store, or looking up a contact in your phone - these are all real-world examples where binary search is used behind the scenes.

**Reference:** You can use `BinarySearchAct.java` as a sample to understand how binary search works with real-world data (like searching names in a contacts list).

## Objective

Create your own binary search program using a **real-world scenario** (not just plain numbers). Your program should:

- Use a practical, everyday situation (like searching books, products, students, etc.)
- Work with sorted data (this is crucial for binary search to work correctly)
- Show step-by-step output displaying the `left`, `mid`, and `right` pointers
- Demonstrate how the algorithm eliminates half the search space each time

## Requirements

- **Real-world scenario:** Choose a practical application (NOT just searching numbers)
- **Sorted data:** Your array/list must be sorted (A-Z, 1-100, etc.)
- **Binary search implementation:** Correctly implement the algorithm
- **Step-by-step output:** Print the search process showing left, mid, right positions
- **Comments:** Add clear comments explaining your code

## Rubrics (50 points total + 3 bonus)

### Part 1: Code Implementation (10 points)

- Explanation of the algorithm logic (why left/right/mid move) (10 pts)
- Explanation of why the data must be sorted (5 pts)
- Explanation of each major code section/block (10 pts)
- Clarity and understanding demonstrated in explanations (5 pts)
- **Bonus:** Different scenario adaptation (3 pts)

## Two-Meeting Assessment Structure

### Meeting 1 (This week): Code Creation & Submission (10 points)

- Create your binary search program (AI tools are allowed for help)
- Study and understand your code line-by-line
- Submit shareable link from OnlineGDB
- **What to do after submission:** Understand your code deeply and practice recreating the algorithm for different scenarios!

### Meeting 2 (Next week): Live Coding & Explanation (40 points + 3 bonus)

- You will write a binary search program from scratch (no reference materials)
- **Scenario choice:** You may use the same scenario from Meeting 1 if you prefer, but using a different real-world example will demonstrate deeper understanding and earn 3 bonus points for creativity and adaptability
- After coding, you will explain your code line-by-line to the instructor:
  - How binary search works in your scenario (10 pts)
  - Why left/right/mid pointers move the way they do (10 pts)
  - Why your data must be sorted (5 pts)
  - What each major section/block does (10 pts)
  - Overall clarity and demonstrated understanding (5 pts)
  - **Bonus:** Different scenario adaptation (3 pts)

## Learning Approach (AI-Friendly Method)

We recognize that AI tools like ChatGPT exist and can help you learn. Here's the recommended approach:

1. **Use AI to generate code** if you find it challenging
2. **Ask AI to explain it line-by-line** until you fully understand
3. **Understand the logic deeply** - focus on WHY each part works, not just WHAT it does
4. **Practice recreating the algorithm** for different scenarios before Meeting 2
5. **Be ready to explain** every part to show you truly understand

This method ensures you use AI as a learning tool, not just a shortcut. The live explanation shows real understanding.

## Submission Instructions

### This Week (Meeting 1):

1. Create your binary search program
2. Test it thoroughly
3. Go to [OnlineGDB](https://www.onlinegdb.com/)
4. Paste your code and run it to make sure it works
5. Click "Share" and copy the shareable link
6. Submit the shareable link (no file upload needed)

### Next Week (Meeting 2):

- Come prepared to code your program from memory
- Be ready to explain every part of your code
- No reference materials allowed during the live coding session

## Example Scenarios to Consider

- **Library System:** Search for book titles in a catalog
- **Student Roster:** Find student names in a class list
- **Product Inventory:** Search for items in a store inventory
- **Music Playlist:** Find songs in a sorted playlist
- **Employee Directory:** Search for names in a company directory

Choose any scenario that interests you, but make sure your data is sorted!

## Tips for Success

- Start with a small dataset (10-20 items) to make understanding easier
- Practice explaining the algorithm out loud without looking at code
- Try writing it for a different scenario to test your understanding
- Make sure you understand why each line of code is necessary
- Test your program with different search values (found, not found, edge cases)

Good luck! Remember: the goal is not just to create working code, but to truly understand how binary search works and why it's so efficient.
